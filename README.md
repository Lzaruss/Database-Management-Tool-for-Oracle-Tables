# Database-Management-Tool-for-Oracle-Tables

This Java code provides functionality for managing tables in an Oracle database. It allows the user to perform various operations such as consulting the structure of a table, creating a new table, maintaining data in a table, and consulting all the data in any table. The code prompts the user to enter a username and password to connect to the database. It then presents a menu with different options, and the user can choose which operation to perform. The code uses the JDBC API to connect to the database and execute SQL statements.
